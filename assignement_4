1. What exactly is []?
Ans -> Its a empty list which contains no list items.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans -> below code can assign 'hello' string on list
spam = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
spam[2] = 'hello' 
spam
output - [2, 4, 'hello', 8, 10]

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans ->                                      
spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]                                                                         
output - 'd'

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans ->
spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
spam[-1]      
output - 'd'

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans ->
spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
spam[:2]
output - ['a', 'b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans ->
bacon=[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]
bacon.index('cat')
output - 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans ->
bacon=[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]
bacon.append(99)
bacon
output - [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans ->
bacon=[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]
bacon.remove('cat')
bacon
output - [3.14, 'cat', 11, True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans -> The list concatenation operator is +, and the replication operator is * .

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans -> The append() method add the list item at the end and the insert()method add the item anywhere in the list.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans -> The pop(list_index) and  remove()  method can remove values from a list.

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans -> Both lists values and strings can be passed to len(), they have indexes and slices, and can be used in for loops, and can be used with the in and not in operators.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans -> Lists are mutable and tuple are immutable , list can have values added, removed, or changed , while tuples values cannot be changed at all. Also tuples are written using parentheses, (  ), and lists use the square brackets, [  ].

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans - tup=(42)
output -( 42 )

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans -> we can use tuple() method to get list value in tuple form and can use list() method to get tuple value in list form.

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
Ans -> They contain references to list values.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans -> The copy.copy() method do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() method  do a deep copy of a list.only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list.
