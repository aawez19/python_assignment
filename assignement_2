1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer -> The two values of boolean are true and false and we can write it as True and False.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer -> and, or and not are 3 different types of boolean operators.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluates).
Answer -> below is the truth table of each Boolean operator.
AND:
X = A or B
Truth table:

A	B	C
1	1	1
1	0	0
0	1	0
0	0	0

OR:
X = A or B
Truth table:

A	B	X
1	1	1
1	0	1
0	1	1
0	0	0

NOT:
X=not A

A	X
1	0
0	1

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
Answer :
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
[False]
not (5 > 4)
[False]
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
[True]
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) 
[False]
(True and True) and (True == False) 
[False]
(not False) or (not True)
[True]

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer ->
>	  Greater than	
<	  Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal to	
<=	Less than or equal to

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Answer ->
The equal operator use to compare the two values and it will get boolean value as a result.
The assignment operator is use to assign any value to any variable.
If we need to assign the value to variable x we will assignment operator. e.g x=10.
Now if you i want to compare x value with y variable whose value is 12 we can use equal operator e.g x==y

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Answer -> the first block is for first if statement (if spam == 10:) and second block is for second if statement (if spam > 5:) and third block is for else statement.
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
  print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
  print('bacon')
else:
  print('ham')
  print('spam')
  print('spam')
  
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Answer ->
spam = 3
if spam == 1:
  print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
  print('Howdy')
else:
  print('Greetings!')
  

9. If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer ->
An endless loop occurs when a program keeps executing within one loop. To exit out of endless loops on the command line we can press CTRL + C 

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer ->The break statement terminates the whole iteration of a loop and continues just skips the current iteration.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
There will no difference if we use this type of range in for loop and it will be print 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer:
# printing the numbers 1 to 10 using for Loop
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
    
# printing the numbers 1 to 10 using While loop
i=1
while i<11 :
    print(i)
    i=i+1
  
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
